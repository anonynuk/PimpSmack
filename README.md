This is my updated version of SMB Brute by EbolaMan so kudos to him for the original work

...On that note:  I noticed, when using the original version, I as getting nothing but
failures.  I decided to take a quick looksy at the code and I'd edit a line here, there...
and well, as most of you i'm sure can relate to, led to basically a complete re-make of
SMB Brute.

Why the name PimpSmack?  I was literally watching a documentary about pimps and the abuse
they do to their "hoes" - hence the name PimpSmack

What's new?  Basically everything except the idea :)

I did make a GUI version for the people that are going to cry and I will upload that as
soon as I solve 1 minor issue with Visual Studio.

Thank you EbolaMan on the original work, I hope this does you justice :)
